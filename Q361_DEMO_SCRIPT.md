## OPENING (2 minutes)

### Welcome & Introduction
"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to be here.

Today, I want to introduce you to **Q361** — a comprehensive Business Management System that's transforming how modern organizations manage their entire operation, from the moment someone joins your company until they leave.

We've spent the last 18 months building Q361 to solve a real problem: organizations are drowning in disconnected systems. HR data lives in spreadsheets, leave approvals happen via email, onboarding takes weeks, and nobody has a clear picture of what's actually happening in their organization.

Q361 changes that. Everything — and I mean everything — is now in one unified platform."

### Agenda (Show on screen)
- **Dashboard Overview** - The command center
- **Employee Management** - Complete workforce data
- **Leave Management System** - Approval workflows that work
- **Onboarding** - Getting new hires productive fast
- **Projects & Tasks** - Unified project management
- **Content Creation Studio** - Strategic planning and execution
- **Analytics & Insights** - Data-driven decisions
- **Q&A** - Your questions answered

## DEMO TIPS & TRICKS

### Before Demo
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Close all unnecessary tabs
- Have all windows ready in separate browser tabs
- Test internet speed
- Have backup laptop/tablet if demo tech fails
- Print backup slides with screenshots
- Wear professional attire matching company culture

### During Demo
- **Speak clearly** - Technical terminology should be explained
- **Go slowly** - Don't rush. Let people absorb information
- **Make eye contact** - Not staring at screen constantly
- **Ask questions** - "Does your organization face this challenge?" engages audience
- **Show real data** - If possible, use actual employee data (sanitized) not demo data
- **Highlight relevant features** - Skip features not relevant to this audience
- **Pause for questions** - Don't power through. Engagement matters more than covering everything

### Timing Management
- **5 min per section** - Don't spend 15 minutes on one feature
- **Watch the clock** - End on time or slightly early (respect their time)
- **Save Q&A** - Last 5 minutes for questions
- **If running long** - Skip "Implementation" and "ROI" sections temporarily

### Handling Interruptions
- **Technical glitch?** - "Let me pull this up. Meanwhile, let me explain what you're about to see..."
- **Tangent questions?** - "Great question. Let me note that and we can discuss after the demo."
- **Skeptical person?** - Involve them. "What's your biggest pain point with current system? Let me show how Q361 solves that."

### If Demo Fails
- **Have screenshots** - Prepared images of key screens
- **Tell the story** - Walk through workflow verbally
- **Offer one-on-one demo** - "I'll give you a personal walkthrough when tech is back up"
- **Provide documentation** - "Here's our complete guide" (show PDF)
